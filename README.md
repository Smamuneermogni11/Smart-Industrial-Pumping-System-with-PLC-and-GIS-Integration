# Smart-Industrial-Pumping-System-with-PLC-and-GIS-Integration
🚀 Application Overview:

We’re designing a dual-pump control system that mimics what you’d find in a real-world industrial facility like:
	•	🔧 Water Treatment Plant
	•	🌾 Irrigation & Agriculture Station
	•	🏭 Manufacturing Plant Utility System
	•	☀️ Solar-Powered Water Movement Station
	•	🛢️ Chemical Storage or Flood Mitigation Unit

This system is built to control pumps based on water levels, alert operators when danger levels are reached, and be structured according to UL 508A electrical safety standards.

⸻

🎯 Main Purpose of the Project:

To simulate and document a real-world-ready, fully integrated control system using:
	•	🧠 PLC for logic
	•	💡 AutoCAD Electrical for design
	•	💻 C programming for interface (HMI)
	•	🗺️ ArcGIS Pro for mapping
	•	⚠️ UL 508A compliance for industrial safety

⸻

🔁 How the System Works (In Real Life):
	1.	Water Level is Low
🔹 A float switch (FS1) closes →
🔹 PLC activates Pump 1 by energizing K1 contactor →
🔹 Water is pumped in until safe level is reached
	2.	Water Level is High (Dangerous)
🔹 Float switch (FS2) triggers →
🔹 PLC activates Alarm (AL1) →
🔹 Operator must press Reset (PB3) once level returns to safe
	3.	Operator Control
🔹 Start/Stop buttons allow manual override
🔹 All control buttons & sensors are tied into the PLC for automation
🔹 Motors are protected by overload relays, and all circuits protected by breakers
	4.	GIS Integration
🔹 The system is mapped in ArcGIS Pro to show pump location
🔹 Overlays for flood zones, power lines, and facilities help visualize the setup in real terrain
